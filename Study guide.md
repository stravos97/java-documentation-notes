## Answer Key


1. new String("hello") creates a new String object in the heap memory, even if its content is "hello". The literal "
   hello" refers to an object in the String Literal Pool. The == operator compares references (memory addresses), and
   since these are two distinct objects in different memory locations, the comparison returns false.
1. The filename must be MyClass.java. This is a strict rule for public classes in Java: the filename must exactly match
   the public class name (case-sensitive) and end with .java. Non-public classes do not have this filename matching
   requirement.
1. Constructor chaining is the practice of one constructor calling another constructor within the same class to reuse
   initialisation logic. This is achieved using the this(...) keyword, which must be the first statement in the calling
   constructor.
1. After scanner.nextInt(), the newline character left in the input buffer is consumed by the subsequent
   scanner.nextLine(), causing it to read an empty string. This is resolved by adding an extra scanner.nextLine() call
   immediately after the nextInt () (or nextDouble()) to consume the leftover newline.
1. The JVM provides an abstraction layer between Java bytecode and the underlying hardware and operating system. Java
   code is compiled into platform-independent bytecode, which the JVM then interprets or Just-In-Time (JIT) compiles
   into native machine code specific to the platform, enabling "Write Once, Run Anywhere."
1. An instance variable resides in the heap memory as part of an object and has the same lifetime as that object. A
   static variable, however, belongs to the class itself, resides in the method area (or Metaspace), and persists as
   long as the class is loaded, regardless of how many objects are created.
1. public makes the method accessible from the JVM. static means it can be called without creating an object of
   MyProgram. void indicates it doesn't return a value. main is the predefined name the JVM looks for as the program's
   starting point, and String[] args allows for command-line arguments.
1. String objects are compared by their content (value) using the equals() method. The == operator, when used with
   objects, compares their memory references (whether they are the _exact same object_), which is generally not what's
   intended when comparing string values.
1. To prevent an infinite loop, the while loop's body must contain a statement that modifies the condition variable(s)
   such that the loop's condition will eventually evaluate to false. In a user input scenario, this often involves
   reading a new input within the loop and updating a boolean flag or the input string itself.
1. You would use a static variable. A static variable belongs to the class itself, not to individual objects, meaning
   it would be shared across all Car instances and could be incremented each time a new Car object is created, thus
   accurately tracking the total count.


## Essay Format Questions


1. Discuss the critical differences between == and equals() when comparing objects in Java, particularly in the context
   of String objects and custom classes. How do these differences impact Object-Oriented Programming principles, and
   what are the implications for design decisions like overriding equals()?
1. Explain how Java's class and file naming conventions, along with the strict signature of the main method, contribute
   to the language's overall structure, compilation process, and maintainability. Consider how these rules simplify
   development for both beginners and experienced developers working on large projects.
1. Analyse the multifaceted role of the this keyword in Java, distinguishing its use for constructor chaining (
   this(...)) from its other applications (e.g., referring to instance variables, returning the current object). How
   does this enhance code clarity, prevent shadowing, and support design patterns like fluent APIs?
1. Evaluate the Scanner class as a tool for user input in Java applications. Discuss its strengths and weaknesses,
   common pitfalls (such as mixing input types), and how effective error handling can be implemented. Compare Scanner to
   BufferedReader in terms of use cases and performance characteristics.
1. Detail the architecture and execution flow of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Explain how its various components work
   together to compile, load, verify, and execute Java bytecode, ensuring platform independence and runtime services
   like memory management. Discuss the significance of the JVM in the broader Java ecosystem.


## Glossary of Key Terms


- **== Operator**: A relational operator in Java used to test if two operands are equal. For primitives, it compares
  actual values. For objects, it compares references (memory addresses), returning true only if both references point to
  the exact same object.
- **this Keyword**: A reference variable in Java that refers to the current object. It is used to distinguish between
  instance variables and parameters with the same name, to invoke another constructor in the same class (this(...)), to
  return the current object, or to pass the current object as an argument.
- **static Keyword**: A modifier in Java that makes a member (variable or method) belong to the class itself, rather
  than to any individual object of that class. static members can be accessed directly via the class name without
  creating an object.
- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the common attributes (fields) and behaviours (
  methods) that all objects of that type will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It is a real-world entity created from a class blueprint, possessing its own set
  of attribute values and able to perform actions defined by its class's methods.
- **Constructor**: A special type of method in a class that is invoked automatically when an object is created using the
  new keyword. Its primary purpose is to initialise the object's instance variables.
- **Constructor Overloading**: The ability of a class to have multiple constructors, each with a different parameter
  list (signature). This provides flexibility for creating objects in various ways, depending on the available
  initialisation data.
- **Constructor Chaining**: The process of calling one constructor from another constructor within the same class using
  the this(...) keyword. This helps in reusing initialisation logic and reducing code duplication.
- **public static void main(String[] args)**: The standard entry point for any standalone Java application. The JVM
  looks for this exact method signature to begin program execution.
- **String**: A class in Java (java.lang.String) that represents sequences of characters. String objects are immutable,
  meaning their value cannot be changed after creation.
- **String Literal Pool**: A special memory area within the JVM's heap where String literals are stored. The JVM tries
  to reuse existing String objects from the pool to save memory when new literals are declared.
- **Scanner Class**: A class in the java.util package used to read user input from various sources, such as the console,
  files, or strings. It provides methods to parse primitive types and strings.
- **while Loop**: A control flow statement in Java that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified
  boolean condition remains true. It is suitable for situations where the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: A virtual machine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It
  is the core component that enables Java programs to achieve platform independence ("Write Once, Run Anywhere").
- **Java Bytecode**: The intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler (javac) from Java source
  code (.java files). Bytecode (.class files) is then executed by the JVM.
- **Keyword**: A reserved word in Java with a special, predefined meaning that cannot be used as an identifier (e.g.,
  variable name, method name, class name). Keywords are always lowercase.
- **Encapsulation**: An Object-Oriented Programming principle that involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods
  that operate on the data within a single unit (a class), and restricting direct access to some of the object's
  components (e.g., using private access modifier).
- **String[] args**: A parameter in the main method that accepts an array of strings, used for passing command-line
  arguments to a Java program when it is executed.
- **Method Area (Metaspace)**: A part of the JVM's memory where class-level data, including static variables and method
  bytecode, is stored. static variables reside here, not in the heap with individual objects.
- **Heap Memory**: A region of the JVM's memory where objects and their instance variables are stored. Objects created
  with the new keyword reside in the heap.
