## Java Class and File Naming Conventions

Your statement about Java programs needing at least one class and matching filenames is mostly spot on, but let's refine
it with precise details. This note serves as a quick reference for understanding these foundational rules—perfect for
beginners building their first apps or experienced devs troubleshooting compilation issues. Feel free to explore the
examples and expand your knowledge by experimenting in your
IDE! [oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html) [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-44-class-and-file-name-in-java/)

## Quick Reference: Key Rules


- **Minimum Requirement**: Every standalone Java program must have at least ==one class== with a
  `public static void main(String[] args)` method as the entry point.

- **Filename Matching**:

	- For `public` classes, the filename **must** match the class name exactly (case-sensitive, ending in `.java`).

	- A single `.java` file can hold multiple classes, but only **one** can be `public`.

	- Non-public classes (default access) don't require filename matching.

- **Best Practice**: Name files after the primary class to keep code organized and avoid errors.


> [!TIP]  
> Use an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse—it automatically enforces naming rules and flags mismatches early.

## When and Why These Rules Matter


- **Real-World Use Cases**: Essential for compilation and execution. Mismatches prevent `javac` from building your code,
  which is common in projects involving packages or modules (\[[Java Modules]\]).

- **Common Pitfalls**:

	- Compilation error: "class X is public, should be declared in a file named X.java" if names don't match.

	- No `main` method leads to runtime error: "Error: Main method not found in class...".


> [!WARNING]  
> Ignoring naming conventions can lead to confusing bugs in larger codebases. Always prioritize clarity—it's a hallmark
> of Java \[[bestpractices]\]. [oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.6)


- **Performance Notes**: These are compile-time rules; they don't impact runtime speed, but good organization aids
  maintainability.

- **Related Concepts**: Explore \[[Java Packages]\] for grouping classes, or \[[Inner Classes]\] which don't need
  separate
  files.


> [!INFO]  
> Java allows flexibility with non-public classes for utility code in the same file, reducing file clutter in small
> projects.

## Syntax and Examples

For syntax questions, here's the exact structure first, followed by explanations.

## Basic Program Syntax


```java
// Filename: ClassName.java (must match if class is public)

public class ClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}

```


- **Explanation**: The `public` keyword makes the class visible externally, tying it to the filename. The `main` method
  is the program's starting point.


> [!EXAMPLE]  
> Here's a practical example in a file named `WeatherAdvisor.java`. This demonstrates a simple weather app—try running
> it to see the rules in action!


```java
// WeatherAdvisor.java - Simple weather advice program

public class WeatherAdvisor {

    // Entry point (required for execution)
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Today's advice: Bring an umbrella if it's raining!");

        // Calling a helper method
        String advice = getWeatherAdvice("sunny");
        System.out.println(advice);
    }

    // Helper method example
    private static String getWeatherAdvice(String condition) {
        if ("sunny".equals(condition)) {
            return "Wear sunscreen!";
        } else {
            return "Stay indoors.";
        }
    }
}

// Additional non-public class (optional, no naming restriction)
class WeatherHelper {
    // Could add more logic here
}

```


- **How to Compile and Run**: Use `javac WeatherAdvisor.java` then
  `java WeatherAdvisor`. [oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html)

- **Expected Output**:


```text
Today's advice: Bring an umbrella if it's raining!
Wear sunscreen!
```


## Multiple Classes in One File

If no public class, filename is flexible. Syntax:


```java
// AnyFileName.java

class EntryClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code here
    }
}

class HelperClass {
    // Additional class
}

```


- **Run Command**: `java EntryClass` (specifies the class with `main`, not the file).


> [!TIP]  
> For beginners, stick to one class per file initially—it simplifies learning. As you advance, experiment with multiple
> classes to see how Java handles them.

> [!EXAMPLE ]- Advanced: Handling Compilation Errors
> If you encounter an error like "public class mismatch," fix it by:
>
> 1. Renaming the file to match the public class.
> 1. Or, remove the `public` keyword if not needed.
>
> Example fix:
>
> ```java
> // Original (error-prone): File named WrongName.java
> public class CorrectName { }  // Error!
>
> // Fixed: Rename file to CorrectName.java
> ```
>
> Save this as a quick debug checklist for real
> projects. [oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.6)

## Comparisons: Public vs. Non-Public Classes


| Feature        | Public Class                   | Non-Public Class          |
|----------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Filename Match | Required (exact match)         | Not required              |
| Visibility     | Accessible from other packages | Limited to same package   |
| Use Case       | Main entry points, APIs        | Helper or inner utilities |
| Max per File   | Only one                       | Multiple allowed          |


> [!NOTE]  
> This table highlights why public classes enforce stricter rules—it's about accessibility and organization in larger
> apps.
